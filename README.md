# Trends_and_Customer_behaviour_analysis
In this repository, I have shared project files in customer segmentation using KMeans Clustering.

Project 1: The First Project is the ETL process and Data cleaning - this contains methods and techniques that are used in data wrangling, cleaning and preprocessing

Project 2: In the second part we will model the data using KMeans Clustering after ward we perform a cross validation procedures with P component analysis to improve our result   

# The Bussiness data Analysis
## Background
some text here

## Objectives
- We will prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis in the notebook including every activities â€“ i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan can be presented to the client too if they wish to see behind the scene. 

- Build a Predictive model that will segment new customers for better customer targetting 

- We will afterward create a BI visulization to deploy our model and give recommendations based on our findings in the analysis 

- We will also create a PowerPoint presentation to includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the phases including activities involved in each.
