the project aimed to help the company understand its performance, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies to drive growth. By leveraging the power of data analysis, the company was able to gain valuable insights into its operations and make data-driven decisions to improve its performance. The use of data cleaning and preprocessing in the EDA phase ensured that the data was accurate and reliable, while the use of KMeans clustering in the segmentation modeling phase allowed the company to group its customers based on similarities in their behavior and tailor its marketing efforts to each segment to increase customer lifetime value. The use of an interactive dashboard and report with visualizations in the deployment phase allowed the company's management team to easily access and interpret the data, enabling them to make informed decisions to improve the company's performance.
